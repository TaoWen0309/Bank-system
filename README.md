# Bank-system

This project combines SQL Server database, Python and HTML to implement a naive bank system that realizes the most basic operations
such as account opening, account cancellation, deposit, withdrawal, and transfer for user operations and
and querying account records and displaying them in charts for banker operations.


In the process of establishing the system, database protocols such as integrity check and security control have been realized, 
and the overall function of the system is verified to be complete.
